# Explanation:

This is a workout tracker app where a user can sign up and then sign in and start recording all the workouts that he completes. Each workout is saved with a name, how much weight was used, how many reps you did, and how many sets you did.

# How to run the app:

You will have to run the frontend and backend at the same time. To do this, you will have to "cd" into each one. Once in the frontend, you will have to run "yarn start" or "npm start" to start the server, and once in the backend, you will have to run "bundle" or "bundle install", and after you will have to run "rails s" to run the backend server.

# Usage:

1. Once you have everything set up and running, you can start by clicking one of the hyperlinks shown.
2. If you do not have an account, you will have to make one by going to the sign up page.
3. Once you are signed in, you are ready to start saving your workouts.
4. When you save the workout you will only be able to see what workout you did and the date you did it so to see more, you have to click the "view more" button
5. When you click the "view more" button you will see all the infor on the workout you did and 2 buttons in the modal
6. On of the buttons closes the modal (the "x") and the other button will delete the workout from your list.
